# 🩺 MediAssist – Easy Medical Report Analyzer

## 📌 Problem
Many elderly people struggle to understand complex medical reports and can’t easily identify the **problem, disease, or cure**.  
That is the problem I wanted to solve.

---

## 💡 Solution
I built **MediAssist**, a simple web app where users can upload their reports and instantly get a **clear, interactive summary** with:

- ✅ Key findings explained in plain language  
- ✅ Possible causes and treatment suggestions  
- ✅ Full support in both **Hindi and English**

---

## ⚙️ How I Built It
- Built with the help of **Google AI Studio’s Build AI**, which generated the core code.  
- Integrated **Gemini API** to process medical reports and provide simplified, bilingual summaries.  
- **Tech Stack:**
  - React + TypeScript → Interface & logic  
  - HTML → Structure  
  - Tailwind CSS (via CDN) → Styling  
  - JSON → Metadata  

---
